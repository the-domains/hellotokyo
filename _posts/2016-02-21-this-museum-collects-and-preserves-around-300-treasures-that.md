**UENO**

_How to get there:_

Walk to Ebisu and Take JR (Yamanote Line, it's the green one) straight to Ueno.

_Things to see:_

1 National Museum of Western Arts (Le Corbusier building, the art is so so, so no need to go in unless you like the show, but the building and the sculpture little garden is nice)

2 Gallery of Horyuji Treasure (very nice, very calm, very beautiful building)

3 Tokyo National Museum (it's a big, traditional museum focused on Japanese art, some good stuff in it, you probably want to walk through it quickly)

(for 2 and 3 you'll need to buy a ticket, they are in the same complex)

_Then_

4 Zoo

5 Shinobazu Pond (on the other side of the park is a very nice pond, you'll see it on the map) - the zoo will take you around here if you walk all the way

Sometimes there's food stalls in the park, eat there

From UENO, you can go to Nippori, if the weather is nice

**NIPPORI**

(only go if it doesn't rain since you need to walk around, or if you have a lot of time)

How to get there:

Just two stops away from Ueno, really traditional old Tokyo neighborhood

Things to see:

1 You can walk through the big cemetery (if it doesn't rain), it's really beautiful

2 Lots of temples along the way, just take a look

2 go to an art gallery called SCAI the Bathhouse, you can google it, it's nice walk from the station

**ASAKUSA**

(very close to UENO)

_How to get here:_

From Ueno it's the Ginza line, direct, about 15 minutes

_Things to see:_

It's the old traditional town center of Tokyo

- There's this really old (oldest?) big temple called Senso-ji, which you must see

- All around is small street with merchants and traditional stores

- And more temples of course

- Plenty of places where to eat

(just walk around the temple)

- - -

Summary:

UENO + NIPPORI (optional) + ASAKUSA is definitely a full day.

You can have lunch in Ueno or Nippori and dinner in ASAKUSA (lots of food in Asakusa).
