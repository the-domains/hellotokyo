Sushi

: Try and get a reservation at Sushi Bar Yasuda:

. Not sure if you've been to Yasuda in NYC before, but it was definitely my favorite sushi restaurant. Yasuda himself moved back to Tokyo a couple years ago and has a small sushi bar that's amazing. It's been hard to make reservations since he's been on Bourdain, but worth a try!

Tonkatsu

: For some delicious pork cutlet, I would definitely check out Maisen:

. The main restaurant is in Omotesando (close to the office, and very close to Omotesando Koffee).

Ramen

: My favorite ramen is this place called Afuri. There are a few around, one in Harajuku, one in Naka Meguro, one in Ebisu. Here's the directions to the one in Harajuku: 3 Chome-63-1 Sendagaya, Shibuya, Tokyo 151-0051\. They are known for their Yuzu Salt Ramen. Tip: Make sure you put the money into the vending machine first before selecting your bowl (I remember I kept pressing the button but nothing would happen because you needed to put the money in first!)

Ramen 2

: Just because there are so many different types of ramen, had to add a second one. Ichiran. There are a few around, but there's one in Harajuku area, as well as Shibuya. Personal booth ramen at it's finest. Thicker broth:

Soba

: My favorite soba is this place called Kawakami-an. They have a few different types, but I personally like the tempura soba where they give you a whole set of tempura on the side and you get the soba to dip into the broth. Close to Omotesando:

Yakiniku

: Delicious grilled meat. One of the best places is called Jumbo. Really hard to make reservations, but definitely worth trying:

Teishoku

: If you want a more regional homemade-like Japanese meals, I would recommend D47 Shokudo in the Hikarie Department Store in Shibuya.

. They create meals that are specialized from different regions within Japan. This month, they are specializing in food from Shiga prefecture
