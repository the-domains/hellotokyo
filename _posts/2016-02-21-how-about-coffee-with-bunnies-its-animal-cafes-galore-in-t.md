How about coffee with bunnies? It's animal cafés galore in Tokyo Tokyo has achieved world-wide fame due to its animal cafés. The original craze started with cat cafés, but has slowly expanded to accommodate a wide range of animal lovers. High time for a list, we thought. Of course, we had some ethical concerns as well, so we sought out those cafés that seemed as animal-friendly as possible, with few to no cages and enough space to wander. Whether the animals seemed stressed or not, and was well-cared for was a factor as well. Bonus points for those who give the animals 'off time', in which you're not allowed to pet them or be near them. With this in mind, we've compiled our top spots around the capital, ranging from the ubiquitous cats down to snakes and owls. Note: venues either have a cover charge or require one drink order.
