## SUSHI 

**Harutaka** This should be easier than the other popular sushi restaurants.
If I remember correctly, he was Jiro's apprentice. Don't book the one in Mitsukoshi, book the one in Ginza 8chome.

**Saito**
As good as Mizutani but hard to get a table

**Kanesaka** I am not sure the relation with Saito, but [this is the place to eat tuna][0]. 

**Kyubei**
Only when you [dine at a counter and order Anago][1]

**Jiro**
If you walk in, they might have a table available but no chance to book a table via phone.
It worth trying the one in Roppongi Hills though.
