used to be primarily financial district

more relaxed than other shopping districts

Naka Dori is main street

Subway: Otemachi, Yurakucho, Tokyo

100% Chocolate Cafe // "best chocolate store interior on earth, has to be seen"

Marni // "melting chrome interior by Future Systems"

APC // "one of the best store interiors in Tokyo"

Shin Marunouchi Building // 7th floor open terrace (Sf)

Muji Supermarket // largest Muji store, only one that carries whole line, good organic cafe

This is the flagship Muji store and even has a Muji House in the center of it. Muji to

me is a place that Target can aspire to be. And definitely go to the one in Yurakucho.

Tokyo International Forum // massive event space in spectacular building. Takarai sake bar in basement
