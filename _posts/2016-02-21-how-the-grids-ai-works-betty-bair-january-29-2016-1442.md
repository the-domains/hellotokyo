How The Grid's AI works Betty Bair January 29, 2016 14:42 The Grid is the world's first A.I. design platform that designs websites.

Think of it as your own personal AI Designer. We did a brief demo of The Grid at Entrepreneur's Startups to Watch event at Social Media Week New York. In this video, our founder and CEO Dan Tocchini IV shows how The Grid works.
