Kyu Asakura House and garden is a great place to step back in time By David Hallman, October 2012 The chic streets of Daikanyama with its high end boutiques, foreign embassies, and world class cuisine represents the modern, bank account depleting reality that has come to epitomize Tokyo. But hidden amongst the luxury handbags and "vintage" (read shockingly expensive) clothing shops is a small glimpse of another reality, one of traditional Japanese architecture and meticulously manicured gardens. Kyu Asakura House is the perfect place to see both, especially when you need to escape that world of relentless retail and the sounds of high heels clacking on pavement. Why not replace that with the serenity of a moss garden, the comfortable give of soft tatami under your socks, and the creaking sounds of a well preserved wooden mansion?
