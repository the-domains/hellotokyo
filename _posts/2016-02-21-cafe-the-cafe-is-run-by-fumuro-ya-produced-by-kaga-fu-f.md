Most expensive land on earth

Grid-like but can be disorienting

Recent development adding new luxury retail stores

Subway: Ginza

Herm√©s // Renzo Piano designed

Also, Hermes museum at the 8th floor, definitely go

Mitsukoshi // 1-4-1 Nihonbashi Muromachi / oldest department store in Tokyo, 10am bells and bows ceremony, kimono floor has great service

The basement floor (of typically any department store) is a must. It's the food floor and truly inspirational.

Shiseido Art Gallery

It's an interesting art space in the basement, across from the Shiseido HQ in Ginza
